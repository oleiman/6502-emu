Load the 48 KB binary into your emulator's memory space at $4000, which leaves 16 KB of read-write RAM below it. 
When the test has finished executing, the value in address $0210 should be $FF, if your CPU passed. 
You will know that the test is finished when the program counter (PC) has reached address $45C0.
